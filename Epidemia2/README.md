# sym4delphi
Less or more outdated simulations designed for _DELPHI_ compilers. From 2000-2010 

__Epidemic2 - educational example from 2011-14__

![Screen shot of version 2.](./EpidemicNetv2.png?raw=true "Epidemic v2. during run")

Do not use "__Paint image__" & "__Save image__" buttons! It may cause application hang! 

"__Konfiguracja__" means "__config__", and could be used only before simulation or after it was finished.

If you want to compile source code, unit ALGO is currently available here:
